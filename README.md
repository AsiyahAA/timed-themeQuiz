# timed-themeQuiz
## Description
### Project purpose was to create timed quiz with questions and multile choice answers with a timer that starts when user starts quiz and subtracts time for every wrong answer selected. Once quiz is completed, user should be able to input their initials and quiz scores should be saved in local storage and displayed on page.
## User
### User should be able to see a a clear header and buttons associated with the quiz. User should see question and answer buttons once intial start button is pressed. Questions should appear after button "Next Question" is selected and a timer should start from the first question. Correct answer should be highlighted in green and wrong answers highlighted in red. Once user is on the final question, "Next Question" button should no longer be visible and user can now select "End Quiz" which will make all other buttons to be no longer visible and open a prompt box that user can enter their initials. Their score, along with their intials should be displayed on page. User can reload the page to start quiz again and see that their previous scores can also be seen upon completion of quiz again.    
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to make a code from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update website.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make a new HTML file titled index.html, a new CSS folder titled style.css, and a new JavaScript folder called script.js and make sure that both the CSS and JavaScript folders are linked on the HTML file. The CSS stylesheet should be linked in the "head" section/tag while the JavaScript sheet should be linked on the bottom of the bag in the "body" section/tag. Start on HTML code and once that is completed, start on your CSS file, and then on the JavaScript file and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Browser" extention-search for and install "Open in Browser" extention in the VS side bar. 
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. Once changes are uploaded, navigate to the settings where your repository is displayed on GitHub and scroll down to Pages in the sidebar. Once there, under Source, select Branch:main and save. A link will then appear and although it will take time, the website will be ready.

## Status 
### Unfortunetly, quiz has many errors that need to be fixed. Questions do not appear after an answer selection but when button "Next Question" is pressed. Button functions on questions 1 and 2 do not properly work and instead of each button working individually, one button selects all other button options. Timer does not stop when user submits all questions before timer runs out nor does it subtract time from any wrong answers selected.
